Why I am trying to do this?Problems I am Solving
This schema provides a structured and organized way to manage employee data for a company. It can solve several problems related to employee management, including:
1. Difficulty tracking employee information: Provides a way to store and track employee information in a centralized location, making accessing and managing employee data easier.
2. Inefficient employee data management: The schema includes triggers and stored procedures that automate certain tasks and make the system more efficient, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.
3. Lack of visibility into employee work hours: The view table allows for easy retrieval of information on employee work hours, making it easier for managers to monitor employee productivity and ensure that employees are working the appropriate number of hours.
4. Difficulty in adding new employees to the system: The stored procedure makes it easy to add new employees to the system, ensuring that all necessary data is entered correctly and reducing the risk of errors or omissions.

How I am trying to do this?
1. SQL statements to create tables, define their relationships, and add data to them. 
2. Trigger to log employee data when adding a new employee.
3. Stored procedure to add new employees
4. The view table to retrieve information on employees and their work hours.
